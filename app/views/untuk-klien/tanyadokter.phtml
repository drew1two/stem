<h3 class="box_header">Q&#038;As</h3>
<br />
<span class="darkblue heavy">Q: Most people tend to associate Leukaemia with blood cancer. Are there other kinds of blood cancers that people should be aware of?</span>

<p>A: It’s not wrong to associate blood cancers immediately with Leukaemia because it seems the most appropriate definition. For us haematologists, we include Lymphoma, Myeloma and Leukaemia. These three are the most common type of blood cancers.</p>

<p>Firstly, these cancers originate from the blood tissues or cells found in the blood. You have different types of blood cells – white blood cells, red blood cells, plasma and platelets. Cancer of the white blood cells is known as Leukaemia. This occurs when there is an abnormal increase of these cells in the body. Cancer of the plasma cells is known as Myeloma. Lymphoma refers to the cancer in the lymphatic cells of the immune system where these lymphoid cells present itself as a solid tumour. People should also know that if you have a high level of platelets in your blood, it is not cancer even though we still consider this to be a bone marrow problem. However, in some cases – 5 to
10 per cent – these cells may develop into Leukaemia years later.</p>

<span class="darkblue heavy">Q: Can I still store my baby’s cord blood if my wife or I have Thalessemia minor/major?</span>

<p>A: Having Thalassemia Minor or the Thalassemia trait is usually a mild blood disorder. Your life expectancy is normal and you are not prone to more medical illnesses than any other person. However, you should inform your obstetricians of your carrier status during the early antenatal period so that screening tests can be done.</p>

<p>As long as the baby is not at risk of being a Thalassemia Major, cord blood can be collected and stored, especially for autologous (one’s own) usage. The cord blood stem cells of babies born with Thalassemia Major are defective and hence, not useful for storage.</p>

<span class="darkblue heavy">Q: I was told that I can’t store my baby’s cord blood if I’m a Hepatitis carrier. Is this true?</span>

<p>A: On the contrary, Hepatitis B carriers (especially mothers) can actually store their child’s cord blood, strictly for autologous use without any major issues. Your baby will usually be vaccinated at birth and immunised against the same virus. Hence, even in the worst case scenario where the cord blood is contaminated with the virus, the immunised child will be protected. Furthermore, there are now many effective medications that can eradicate the virus even if one becomes infected. While there are no vaccines available for the Hepatitis C virus as yet, there are effective treatments that can eradicate the virus. Therefore, storing cord blood is still feasible.</p>

<p>However, the cord blood will have to be more strictly examined if it is to be used. The pros and cons of using the cord blood must be weighed more carefully and the usage of the cord blood must be solely for autologous purposes.</p>

<span class="darkblue heavy">Q: I am 8 months pregnant and am considering storing my son’s cord blood. Is it still possible to use my child’s cord blood if he develops a disease? Won’t the cord blood contain the cancer cells or affected/abnormal genes that developed into the disease?</span>

<p>A: It is a widely known fact that stem cells, whether they are from cord blood, bone marrow, peripheral blood or adipose tissue, have all been successfully used to treat diseases through both Stem Cell Transplants (SCT) and Regenerative Therapy. This is possible because some diseases are not due to abnormal genes.</p>

<p>For example, cerebral palsy is caused by hypoxia (a lack of oxygen to the brain) and can be treated with Regenerative Therapy using your son’s own cord blood stem cells. For other cancers like Wilm’s tumour, a type of childhood cancer, the cancer does not originate from the bone marrow or cord blood. Using one’s own cord blood stem cells can actually increase the chances of cure as they have not been exposed to chemotherapy and are therefore better in quality.</p>

<p>For Leukaemias, the best chance of a cure is to use stem cells from a fully matched sibling or unrelated donor. If no such donors are available, using your son’s stored cord blood stem cells is a reasonable option. Data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry shows that autologous SCTs provide cures. However, for certain conditions such as haemogloblinopathies (e.g. thalassaemia major or sickle cell anaemia), the defect is inherent in the bone marrow cells. A donor will be needed to provide stem cells without the primary defect for a SCT.</p>

<p>Therefore, while there is some truth that the presence of abnormal genes may prevent the use of stem cells in some diseases, there are many other types of diseases where the usage is not influenced by this concern at all.</p>
